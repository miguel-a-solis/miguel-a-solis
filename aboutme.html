		<p>Since February 2020 Miguel is Head on the Robotics and Automation career at <a href="http://www.unab.cl" target="_blank">UNAB</a>, Santiago, Chile. Just before that date since July 2018 Miguel was an interim academic at <a href="http://www.ucn.cl" target="_blank">UCN</a>, Antofagasta, Chile. Previously, from April 2017 until June 2018, he was an Instructor Professor at <a href="http://www.unab.cl" target="_blank">UNAB</a>, Viña del Mar, Chile. Miguel has graduated in April 2017 with Doctor of Engineering on Informatics at <a href="http://doctorado.inf.utfsm.cl/" target="_blank">UTFSM</a>, whose institution distinguished Miguel with the Academic Excellence Award, given by <a href="http://dgiip.usm.cl/" target="_blank">Dirección General de Investigación, Innovación y Postgrado at UTFSM</a>, the same institution where he obtained his M.Sc. on Electronics and professional title of Electronics Engineer, both in 2012.
		<p>He was a member of <a href="http://innovacionyrobotica.usm.cl/" target="_blank">Innovación y Robótica Estudiantil</a> for eight years, since his last years of undergraduate studies on 2009 and his whole graduate studies until 2017. Then in December 2016, he assumes the role of General Secretary at the constitution of the NGO <a href="http://www.innovacionyrobotica.com" target="_blank">Centro de Innovación y Robótica</a>, institution which intends to support the students initiative and aims to bridge the gap between academia and industry, with a high impact on society. Miguel has taken the opportunity to provide technical assistance for some requirements from aforementioned NGO.</p>
		<p>During his stance on the self-powered students initiative, he was able to participate in several projects, working on teams for participating in events such as <a href="http://www.larc10.fei.edu.br/" target="_blank">Latin American Robotics Competition</a> or <a href="http://www.robocup2014.org/" target="_blank">RoboCup Small Size League</a>. Miguel led the organization of <a href="http://congresorobotica.usm.cl/" target="_blank">Congress on Robotics and Neuroscience</a> in 2015 and 2016, supporting the 1st <a href="http://www.roboticsweekla.com" target="_blank">Latin American Robotics Week</a> in 2016. He has also been invited for some talks on topics related to his research work, with research interests on adaptive control, cognitive robotics, and reinforcement learning.</p>
		
		<p>Miguel has been elevated to Senior Member at <a href="https://www.ieee.org" target="_blank">IEEE</a> on 2022, and was elected to serve as Chair at <a href="https://ras.ieeechile.cl" target="_blank">IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Chile Centro</a> for 2022-2023. Miguel has also served as Vice-Chair 2023-2024 at <a href="https://ieeechile.cl" target="_blank">IEEE Chile Centro</a> and serves as Chair 2025-2026. Since October 2023 has been elevated to Associate Professor at <a href="https://www.unab.cl" target="_blank">UNAB</a>.</p>
